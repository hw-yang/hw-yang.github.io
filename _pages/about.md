Hi! I am Alex, and I am a Psychology PhD student at the University of California at Berkeley. I am currently working in the [Kidd Lab](https://www.kiddlab.com/), under the mentorship of [Dr. Celeste Kidd](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/celeste-kidd). I also work with [Dr. Steve Piantadosi](http://colala.berkeley.edu/people/piantadosi/) and [Dr. Bill Thompson](https://billdthompson.github.io/). I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2021 with a BA in Computer Science, Physics, and Psychology.

Research focus: I use computational methods to build quantitative models of human learning mechanisms, and uses insights from that psychology work as inspiration to advance machine learning techniques.
