Hi! I am Alex, and I am a Psychology PhD student at the University of California at Berkeley. I am currently working in the Kidd Lab, under the mentorship of Dr. Celeste Kidd. I also work with Dr. Steve Piantadosi and Dr. Bill Thompson. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2021 with a BA in Computer Science, Physics, and Psychology.

Research focus: I use computational methods to build quantitative models of human learning mechanisms, and uses insights from that psychology work as inspiration to advance machine learning techniques.
